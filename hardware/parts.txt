Here's what I ordered to make 3x boards. Only 2/3rds of this is needed to make a whole 66-key keyboard. In some cases, I bought some extra parts (the MIN# is higher than it needs to be) because I thought I might break some parts. Using a 75 ohm resistor for the blue LED was a mistake. I should have used 150 ohm like with the other LEDs. The blue LED is much brighter, even with its supposedly much higher voltage drop.
